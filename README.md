SkillCraft Technology Task 1:Visualizing student demographic data using bar charts and histogram
Student Data Anlysis Dashboard
Project Overview
This project focuses on visualizing student demographic data using basic data visualization techniques. The goal is to analyze and present the distribution of students based on gender and age through appropriate graphical representations.
Using bar charts for categorical data and histograms/grouped charts for continuous data, the project demonstrates how visual analysis can simplify complex datasets and reveal meaningful patterns. These visualizations help in understanding student composition and support effective data-driven insights.
Dataset Information
The Student Performance Data dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains student demographic and academic performance records intended for exploratory data analysis and visualization.  

Key Attributes
Student age
Gender (Sex)
School (GP, MS)
The dataset is used as the primary source for creating the dashboard visualizations
🔗 Dashboard Components
🔗1.Distribution of Students by Gender 
Displays the count of students based on gender.
Helps identify gender balance across the dataset.
🔗2.Age Distribution of Students 
Visualizes student count across different age groups.
Helps understand the age range and concentration of students.
🔗Tools & Technologies Used
Tableau – For data visualization and dashboard creation
CSV File – Data source format
Windows OS – Development environment
🔗Project Files
student_data.csv – Dataset used for analysis
Student_Data_analysis.twbx – Tableau packaged workbook
Dashboard Screenshot – Visual preview of the analysis
🔗How to Use the Project
1.Open Tableau Desktop.
2.Load the file Student_Data_analysis.twbx.
3.Interact with the dashboard to explore student data insights.
🔗Key Insights from the Dashboard
1.Gender Distribution
The bar chart shows the distribution of students by gender.
Female students slightly outnumber male students in the dataset.
This indicates a relatively balanced gender composition with a small female majority.
2.Age Distribution
The age distribution chart highlights how students are spread across different age groups.
Most students fall within the 16–18 age range, showing a clear concentration in this group.
Very few students are observed outside this age range, indicating a fairly uniform age structure.
🔗Conclusion
This dashboard provides a simple yet effective way to analyze student data visually
