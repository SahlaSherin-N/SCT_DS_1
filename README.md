Task 1:Visualizing student demographic data using bar charts and histogram
Student Data Anlysis Dashboard
🔗Project Overview:
This project visualizes student demographic data to analyze the distribution of gender and age using basic data visualization techniques.

🔗Dataset Information:
The Student Performance Data dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains student demographic and academic performance records intended for exploratory data analysis and visualization.  

🔗Key Attributes:
Student age
Gender (Sex)
School (GP, MS)
The dataset is used as the primary source for creating the dashboard visualizations
🔗 Dashboard Components:
🔗1.Distribution of Students by Gender 
Displays the count of students based on gender.
Helps identify gender balance across the dataset.
🔗2.Age Distribution of Students 
Visualizes student count across different age groups.
Helps understand the age range and concentration of students.
🔗Tools :
Tableau – For data visualization and dashboard creation
🔗Project Files:
student_data.csv – Dataset used for analysis
Student_Data_analysis.twbx – Tableau packaged workbook
Dashboard Screenshot – Visual preview of the analysis
🔗How to Use the Project:
1.Open Tableau Desktop.
2.Load the file Student_Data_analysis.twbx.
3.Interact with the dashboard to explore student data insights.
🔗Key Insights from the Dashboard:
1.Gender Distribution
The bar chart shows the distribution of students by gender.Female students slightly outnumber male students in the dataset.This indicates a relatively balanced gender composition with a small female majority.
2.Age Distribution
The age distribution chart highlights how students are spread across different age groups.Most students fall within the 16–18 age range, showing a clear concentration in this group.Very few students are observed outside this age range, indicating a fairly uniform age structure.
🔗Conclusion:
This dashboard provides a simple yet effective way to analyze student data visually
