# Student Data Analysis – Task 01
#Internship Task – SkillCraft Technology
This repository contains Task 01 of my internship at SkillCraft Technology, focused on data visualization using a bar chart and a histogram.
#Task Description
The objective of this task is to create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as:
Gender distribution (categorical)
Age distribution (continuous)
#Visualizations Included
#Bar Chart – Distribution of Students by Gender

Helps in understanding gender-wise distribution clearly
#Histogram – Age Distribution of Students
Shows how students are distributed across different age groups
Helps identify common age ranges and trends

# Dataset
Sample student dataset containing:
Age
Gender
(Dataset used only for educational and internship purposes.)
#Key Learnings
Understanding the difference between bar charts and histograms
Visualizing categorical vs continuous data
Creating clean and readable charts
Improving data interpretation skills
##Conclusion
This task helped me strengthen my basics in data visualization and understand how graphical representations make data insights easier to analyze.
